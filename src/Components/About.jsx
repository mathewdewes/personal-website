                <p> My name is Mathew. I am a young upcoming web developer looking to find my first opportunity towards becoming a front end developer. For the past year I have dedicated as much time as I can towards learning everything there is to know about web development and in the process I have found a real passion in creating web applications. After working in warehousing for several years and gaining many useful skills along the way I have made the decision to pursue my new found joy and fully commit myself towards achieving my current goal of becoming a full stack web developer. My current strengths lie in React, Javascript and UX design following databases and apiâ€™s. I am currently undergoing a Diploma in Web and UX Design as well as a Python Pro course which I am striving to achieve.
                    To whomever this message finds, are there any opportunities that you are willing to give me towards entering this industry. I am looking for full time employment but more than happy to work part time and or voluntary to show my potential. I cannot express all that I need to say on this website so feel free to contact me on my contact me page.
